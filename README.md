# Burn the Old

**Minimalistic latin american tradition for new year. Burn all what you don't want in your life anymore.**

A web-based 3D simulation of the traditional "Mu침eco de A침o Viejo" burning ritual for New Year. Users can interact with a 3D model, add the things they want to leave behind in the past year, and watch the mu침eco burn at midnight.

## Features

- **3D Mu침eco Model**: A low-poly, interactive doll rendered using Three.js and React Three Fiber.
- **User Interaction**: Users can submit what they want to leave behind, and their submissions are displayed around the mu침eco.
- **Burning Animation**: The mu침eco burns at midnight, symbolizing renewal and starting fresh.
- **Database Integration**: User submissions are stored in a NeonDB database using Prisma.
- **Environmentally Friendly**: A digital alternative to the traditional burning ritual, reducing environmental impact.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: For building the web application.
- **Three.js & React Three Fiber**: For 3D rendering and animations.
- **Prisma**: For database access and management.
- **NeonDB**: For lightweight and efficient cloud database hosting.
- **Tailwind**: For styling components.
